// Grammar-driven prompt surfaces (v2 hardening, question-audit follow-up).
// The audited low-variety categories moved from flat template lists to small
// context-free grammars (persona.Grammar): clause order, synonym slots, and
// optional phrases multiply the surface a template matcher must cover to
// hundreds of distinct prompts per category before the lead-in/trailer wrap
// composes on top. Every alternative is hand-reviewed against the category's
// routing intent: a production must never flip the correct tool (a status
// check must not read as a dispatch, an edit must not read as a create) and
// must never leak an answer. The %s fill for pinned arguments stays OUT of
// the grammar: datagen expands first, then fills, so pinned tokens are never
// rewritten by expansion.

// agentReadGrammar covers the run-vs-read trap's READ side: the user asks
// about background jobs that already exist. No production may ask to start
// anything new.
