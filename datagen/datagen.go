//     with that URL (toolexec link-chain gate), so the harness must read the

//     cannot be faked and the snippet cannot be grepped (it carries the scored
//     decoy).

//     job-id chain AND transient-error recovery at once. The first
//     get_agent_job_status call returns a transient error; the retry must carry
//     the job id execute_agent_job served. Both gates already exist in toolexec
