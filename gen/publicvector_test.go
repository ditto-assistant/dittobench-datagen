// TestKnownVector pins the canonical hash of a fixed seed so any change that
// alters generator output is caught in review. The validators run this same
// module, so this is also the byte-parity anchor between this public repo and the
// private scoring service. The hash is a function of (seed, bench_version): a
// bench_version bump rotates the surface (RotateSeed) and moves it by design.
// Update it only on a deliberate generator change or a bench_version bump.
func TestKnownVector(t *testing.T) {
	const (
		seed = int64(123456789)
		// Deliberate change (audit follow-up item A, bench_version 2): the five
		// audited low-variety tool categories moved from flat template lists to
		// CFG grammar expansion (persona.Expand), which changes both the emitted
		// prompts and the per-case RNG draw counts.
		//
		// Moved again (anti-gaming addendum N2, bench_version 2): the metamorphic
		// invariance twin became a j=3 sibling FAMILY (invarianceTwins) instead of
		// a seed-selected pair, so the run emits one more consistency case and the
		// twin phrasing-set selection changed.
		//
		// Moved again (prod hardening P1+P6, bench_version 2): write-then-read
		// lifecycle chains joined the memory suite (gen/lifecycle.go) and the
		// point-in-time modality joined question derivation, changing the case
		// mix, wave-0 pairs, and RNG draw counts.
		//
		// Moved again (metamorphic multi-family, bench_version 2): question
		// derivation now emits several invariance families (invarianceTwins) and
		// the memory suite selects twinFamiliesFor(n) of them (full=3), so the twin
		// case count and attribute selection changed. This smooths the
		// metamorphic-consistency composite factor from a per-run coin flip.
		//
		// Moved to bench_version 3 (anti-gaming hardening; on-chain scoring went
		// live 2026-07-13 so this is the first post-launch version). The version
		// bump rotates the surface via RotateSeed, and value-recall memory cases
		// now carry a DumpGuard (the user's other current self values) so the
		// grader can zero a whole-self-table answer dump. DumpGuard is part of the
		// auditable answer-key artifact, like DistractorAnswers, never sent to the
		// harness. Further v3 surface changes (needle gating, synthesis types,
		// adversarial distractors) re-pin this hash as they land.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 needle gating): the result-usage needle is now served only
		// by the case's needle-bearing tool with a per-seed sentence template and an
		// inline decoy, so NeedleText (part of the artifact) changed.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 synthesis anti-shortcut): recurring-topic mentions now use
		// coreference (only the anchor names the topic; follow-ups are oblique) so
		// literal-label counting undercounts, and opinion reversals are conveyed by
		// sentiment rather than a fixed cessation lexicon. Both change haystack
		// surface (RNG draw counts held constant, so timestamps/durations did not
		// shift).
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 red-team gate): the recurring anchor's acknowledgment turn
		// no longer echoes the full topic label (it stays oblique), so the label
		// appears exactly once in the haystack and a literal-label counter always
		// undercounts. Surface-only change.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 adversarial distractor): each run now seeds one NoOp /
		// knowledge-conflict "considered but rejected" mention (KindNegated) whose
		// value becomes a distractor for that attribute's recall, so a similarity
		// retriever that grabs it scores 0. Added via a derived rng + deterministic
		// session, so the main stream (timestamps/durations) is unperturbed.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 anti-laundering, this change): three surface-affecting
		// additions. (1) Coined tokens (canary nonce/bait, injection payload,
		// lifecycle read answers) now share one per-seed SHAPE family
		// (persona.CoinShaped) — grammar collision, so a token-shape output
		// scrubber deletes its own answers — changing every coined token's text.
		// (2) The run's injection payload is planted once as an innocuous stored
		// "warranty reference" fact (KindDistractor), a new haystack pair, to
		// defeat the context-membership scrub. (3) An injection-framing invariance
		// family (persona.injectionTwins) joins the memory suite on medium/full
		// runs — one fact attacked via several override framings, one of them an
		// action-bait framing carrying MemoryCase.BaitTool — changing the case mix
		// and RNG draw counts. The coined-token character stream also moved to
		// splitmix64 mixing (the prior LCG low bits were nearly salt-independent,
		// so distinct salts could collide to the same token). The broad single
		// injection loop now also SKIPS the injection-twin family's attribute (it
		// otherwise emitted a byte-identical attack case under a second id).
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 canary + injection diversification): a SECOND attributed
		// canary decoy nonce is planted (rare-token-dump shortcut now trips a
		// decoy), added as a distractor on the canary question, and three
		// injection templates that embed the real question mid-attack (not
		// trailing) were added to the pool — both change the haystack surface and
		// the injection template selection. The second decoy's entity is drawn to
		// differ from the first decoy's (a small resample loop), which also shifts
		// the RNG stream.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 canary decoy session separation): the second canary decoy's
		// session now provably differs from the first's (on a draw collision it
		// steps to the next session; same rng draw count), enforcing the documented
		// cross-session attribution contract. This seed had a collided pair, so its
		// haystack layout moved.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 result-usage position-tell fix, 2026-07-18): the bearer's
		// served needle sentence no longer places the needle in a fixed first clause
		// before a fixed "(separately," marker. The needle and inline decoy clauses
		// are now joined by a per-seed connective (needleConnectives) in a per-seed
		// order, and the non-bearer decoy sentence is built from the same two-clause
		// family — so a fixed-position / fixed-marker grep can no longer extract the
		// needle or single out the bearer. NeedleText (part of the artifact) changed.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 reproduce-under-transform audit, 2026-07-18): a public,
		// seed-keyed share of each run's cases (persona.AuditBps) is now re-asked
		// under a post-commit transform the harness cannot predict at commit time —
		// an invariance rephrasing (answer unchanged) or a covariance shift (prior
		// state on an update chain, or a different point-in-time boundary, answer
		// recomputed from the same chain). The audit cases are paid for out of the
		// run budget, so the case COUNT is unchanged, but which cases the run
		// carries moved. See persona/transform.go.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 dump-guard half-hedge / candidate salt, 2026-07-18): each
		// value-recall case now carries up to persona.saltDistractors additional
		// same-attribute distractors, drawn from the attribute's own pool and
		// verified absent from the rendered haystack, so a parser that narrows to a
		// few candidates and emits them all trips the distractor scan regardless of
		// DumpFloor. Case distractor lists changed; the haystack did not.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 injection naturalization, 2026-07-18): injection framings are
		// now COMPOSED per seed from independently-varied parts (authority marker,
		// negation clause, payload demand, question placement) instead of drawn from
		// 13 fixed templates, so the shape space is the product of the part pools
		// rather than their sum. Every injection case's text changed. Across a
		// 40-seed sweep the most common shape now covers 1.2% of injection cases.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 cross-user lifecycle probe, 2026-07-18): the isolation layer
		// now carries a write/delete-under-A then read-under-B chain (gen/isolation.go
		// crossUserLifecycle), adding two pairs to the secondary user's haystack and
		// five cases. Lifecycle chains previously carried no user id at all, so a
		// harness with a global saved/deleted map was never exercised across the
		// user boundary.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 audit pairing, 2026-07-18): the audited BASE case now carries
		// the same TwinGroup as its transformed sibling. Without it the pair is
		// unrecoverable downstream -- the scorer pairs base to transform through
		// TwinGroup alone, and a group holding only the transform would look
		// trivially self-consistent and measure nothing.
		//
		// Re-pinned (v3 audit rate 1500 -> 2500 bps, 2026-07-18): the 2026-07-18
		// calibration found a full run produced only ~3.8 audit pairs, of which
		// ~12% were discordant, so a verdict rested on about one informative pair
		// and could not reach significance however the metric was framed. Each
		// audit pair costs ONE extra case slot (the base case was already in the
		// run), so this moves ~7 of a full run's ~59 memory slots to audit
		// coverage.
