// Benchmark versions are immutable generation contracts. CurrentBenchVersion is
// used only for display and release metadata; canonical generation must always
// receive an explicit version so historical datasets remain reproducible after
// a release advances.
//
// v2 is frozen: it is what on-chain scoring has been running since 2026-07-13,
// and its bytes must keep regenerating identically so any already-scored run
// stays auditable. v3 is the ANTI-GAMING release -- dump-guard grading, needle
// gating, adversarial distractors, composed injection framings, the cross-user
// lifecycle probe, and the reproduce-under-transform audit. Every one of those
// is gated on the version, so adding hardening never disturbs v2's bytes.
// v4 is the FALSE-POSITIVE release. v3's anti-gaming machinery penalized a
// number of legitimate behaviours: the canary could be audit-duplicated so one
// breach was charged twice, delete INSTRUCTIONS were graded on echoing a noun
// phrase, and several composite factors taxed a transparent memory agent for how
// it retrieves. Those are corrected here rather than in v3, because a bench
// version is an immutable contract: v3's bytes and its already-recorded scores
// stay exactly as they were, and re-scoring happens by moving to a new contract
// rather than by rewriting an old one.
// v5 is the CONVERSATIONAL-GROUNDING, COVERAGE, AND EFFICIENCY release (see
// dittobench-api docs/BENCHMARK-V5-PLAN.md). v4 rewarded a phrase-list router that
// recognizes memory writes only through a closed cue family and dumps retrieved
// memory on any unmatched turn (the "Aurora-9" failure): a greeting could surface
// an off-topic seeded value and still score near the top, because no case graded
// conversational relevance and no case tested a plain declarative statement as a
// durable write. v5 adds, all version-gated so v4's bytes and already-recorded
// scores are untouched:
//   - a conversational-sanity gate (greeting non-leak, declarative acknowledgement,
//     abstention-over-confabulation) and ordinary no-save-verb declarative writes
//     with their persistence and behavior-change proofs;
//   - the accept-set grading primitive (non-verbatim answers), Code Mode tool
//     coverage, and harder capability dimensions (multi-hop relational KG joins,
//     temporal-depth), all high-entropy and metamorphic-twinned to resist overfit;
//   - a token-efficiency (waste-penalty) contract the validator applies from
//     trusted relay telemetry, binding generation, model/provider profile, and the
//     starter baseline to one immutable contract.
//
// v6 is the MEMORY-AS-DATA release: stored-instruction injection, multi-query
// fan-out, non-verbatim computed answers, and passive cross-session
// consolidation, all version-gated so v5's bytes are untouched.
// v7 carries the OpenRouter/gpt-oss-20b inference boundary AND is the DIFFICULTY
// release (see docs/bench-versions.md and docs/v7-product-traceability.md). Every
// new case family mirrors a real Ditto product flow, data-model shape, or
// documented failure mode (deep write chains, three-hop KG joins, near-miss
// entity-disambiguation abstention, temporal aggregation, composed
// stored-instruction injection, subscribed-graph attribution; plus dependent
// tool chains). Every lever is gated on bench_version >= 7, so v2..v6 regenerate
// and grade byte-identically. The judge-free deterministic grader is unchanged,
// and the wire/artifact format stays backward-compatible (additive only). The
// difficulty is defined and measured, not asserted. The champion tier is REFIT
// to the leaderboard rebench (five harnesses measured 0.59-0.795 on the
// round-1-deepened suite); the round-3 refitted sim predicts scratch/starter
// case-means of 0.758/0.669 (composite ~0.57-0.66 after the observed robustness
// gate), the best non-reasoning strategy scores ~0.09 on the reasoning subset,
// and a correct oracle scores 1.0 on every case across seeds
// (gen.TestV7ChampionTierRefit / TestV7NaiveStrategiesCollapse /
// TestV7OracleSolvable). See docs/v7-product-traceability.md.
//
// v8 is the ANSWERING-MACHINE-PROOF difficulty release. It keeps v7's run sizes,
// inference model, and runtime envelope, but makes the seeded tool mix vary,
// makes natural follow-up requests depend on seed-bound prior context, keeps
// exact argument checks for product enums/identifiers while accepting arbitrary
// valid free-form wording, raises the computed-memory floor, and tightens the
// deterministic grader. Every lever is gated on bench_version >= 8 so v7 remains
// independently reproducible.
